### A almost perfect (at least very usable ) paradigm for describing algorithm complexity:
The implementation of C2P algorithm has been given
in previous part, and in the following we prove the results by
analyzing operations in Algorithm 2 line by line.
Line 1 makes the initialization and the corresponding complexity
is Θ(1). **Operations in line 2 to line 10** include two
“for” loops, where the **outer** one traverses all the neighbors
of node v, denoted by wi, with loop times dv and the **inner**
one traverses part of neighbors of relay node wi. Note that
the inner loop does not need to search all the neighbors of
node wi since that some of them do not own cross-layer two-hop
paths to node v. Then, note that **the operation within two loops** is an assignment **with complexity Θ(1)** and thus we
have that the implementation complexity **is upper bounded by**.
Line 11 selects recommendation items based
on nodes’ weights with complexity Θ(1). Combing the above
three parts together, we complete the proof.
