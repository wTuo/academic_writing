# common adjective

**inherent** (refer to a feeling that something can not be cast off)

intrinsic (Due to the intrinsic hardness)(it is hard to distinguish between intrinsic and inherent even for natives)

Adopting the notations in [], ("Participle as 方式adverbial")(**this incomplete sentence by using ADVERBIAL PARTICIPLE offers a writing feeling**)

## long sentence (rule of using comma)

Due to the ..., ... should be interpreted in a probabilistic way, thus naturally leading to ...

Although ..., the focus nowadays, due to the large size of the networks, has mainly been on approximate solutions.

**However, such a pre-computation would lead to an increase of the index storage space and, more importantly, the index building time, which would become O(nm), thus unaffordable for large graphs.**
(the last clause is "adjective phrase as accompanying adverbial", e.g. For a moment she just stood there, unable to believe what had just happened. e.g. Crusoe stared at the footprint, full of fear.(= Crusoe, who was full of fear, stared at the footprint.)) 





**We examine the case where an optimal strategy can be computed efficiently, specifically, the case of ...** (Appositive)(e.g.  It is not a working verb, a verb that can run a sentence by itself.)
(excellent example for the moment when a objective with multiple modifications **2 modifications**  *Use appositive to give an additional information instead of a attribute clause.*) 
### the advanced skill of using comma to form a long sentence (a crucial rule of comma)
[Use a comma to set off parenthetical elements](http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/commas.htm)
- The Founders Bridge, *which spans the Connecticut River*, is falling down. 
- Calhoun's ambition, *to become a goalie in professional soccer*, is within his reach. (Appositive)
- Eleanor, *his wife of thirty years*, suddenly decided to open her own business. (Appositive) 
- He is interested in sports, *especially ball games*. (Appositive)
- **He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.**  **2 modifications** (They designed an algorithm, based on MDP, having prohibitive time complexity.)(We introduce the edge probability, denoted by $p$, describing the uncertainty of the status of an edge.) **please familiar with the mean that Past Participle 作后置定语**

Please pay attention to the sentences marked "2 modifications", which can offer methods to construct sentence when a objective with multiple modifications.
