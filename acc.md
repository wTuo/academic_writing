For convenience/concision of illustration/notations/discussion,


The reasons of this phenomenon are three folded:

Before the detailed description on the algorithm

For convenience, we present Table I to list all notations that will be used in later analysis, proofs and discussions.

This summation is maximized when p = 2 and q = 2.

And finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated on three real datasets.

Take the ... as an example again.      (To illustrate, let us continue to the example of academic networks)

Plug the two expressions into Equation (1)  

The present work is the first attempt towards cross-layer recommendations **with systematic theoretical support**. 

Unlike the Markov inequality that is only **applicable** only to non-negative random variables, the Chernov bound can be applied to all random variables.  

edges are copied following the same way/process.


We note that studying ... is an essential issue and to our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt towards this purpose.

However, as far as we know, no existing work has focused on overlapping communities, an omnipresent case in large-scale social networks.

However, how to mathematically model such networks **remains unexplored**. Motivated by this, 


which, neglected by **prior art**,

**Initially proposed by** Narayanan and Shimatikov, this fundamental issue has then gained increasing attention, leading to a large body of subsequent works

As another means of measuring network graphs, we can define the diameter of a network as the longest of all the calculated shortest paths in a network.

The former is simpler to analyze, and indeed, despite its shortcomings with respect to explaining ..., it has been analyzed extensively. 

Given ..., find ... such that ... is minimized.




Our study is an attempt to understand how social relations may impact on network capacity from a theoretical perspective, and provides fundamental insight on the design and analysis of real wireless networks.

**An extensive empirical study** using real road networks and synthetic data sets shows the effectiveness of the proposed path queries and the efficiency of the query evaluation methods.


We deeply characterize our problem from a theoretical point of view, showing that it is NP-hard.

While being more sophisticated than ..., the ... still suffers from both accuracy and efficiency issues. 

In the rest of the paper, to keep our presentation simple, we write ... as ... as well if no ambiguity, and call a sample xi ∈ wbe as the
sample of the edge.


Therefore, both the graph models and the query types are different from our work. Thus, those techniques cannot be extended straightforwardly to probabilistic path queries on uncertain road networks.


The model is **slightly modified** by 

..., **analytically demonstrating the benefits** of such schemes in terms of throughput capacity.

,which arises in the context of uncertain graphs.

because no initial set of vertices **is specified**

Yuan et al. study **a new variant of** the shortest path problem in an uncertain graph, and Jin et al. study the distance-constraint reachability problem, **a generalization of the classic** two-terminal reliability problem.


we **deviate from natural pattern** mining approaches which focus on bottom-up strategies (level-wise or pattern-growth). Here, we introduce a novel peeling approach which enables top-down pattern discovery.


**We denote by $x$ the collection of $s$-$t$ path, and by $y$ the collecitons of** (A useful paradigm for multiple notations)

## long sentence (rule of using comma)


However, in some extreme cases, the number of paths or cuts **can be** exponentially large, **making** the worst case approximation ratio **still turn out to** be $O(|E|)$.

Let $x$ be a column vector **with** all its elements zero, except for the entry that corresponds to node q; set this entry to 1. 

$w(i,j)$ is the weight of edge connecting i and j. 


The second concept is almost the same but the mapping function is **slightly** different.

Due to the ..., ... should be interpreted in a probabilistic way, thus naturally leading to ...

Although ..., the focus nowadays, due to the large size of the networks, has mainly been on approximate solutions.

**However, such a pre-computation would lead to an increase of the index storage space and, more importantly, the index building time, which would become O(nm), thus unaffordable for large graphs.**
(the last clause is "adjective phrase as accompanying adverbial", e.g. For a moment she just stood there, unable to believe what had just happened. e.g. Crusoe stared at the footprint, full of fear.(= Crusoe, who was full of fear, stared at the footprint.)) 


In cross-layer networks, recommendation is also an essential issue, which, however, suffers from a negative performance since most of existing algorithms only consider a particular layer of the network.


**We examine the case where an optimal strategy can be computed efficiently, specifically, the case of ...** (Appositive)(e.g.  It is not a working verb, a verb that can run a sentence by itself.)
(excellent example for the moment when a objective with multiple modifications **2 modifications**  *Use appositive to give an additional information instead of a attribute clause.*) 
### the advanced skill of using comma to form a long sentence (a crucial rule of comma)
[Use a comma to set off parenthetical elements](http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/commas.htm)
- The Founders Bridge, *which spans the Connecticut River*, is falling down. 
- Calhoun's ambition, *to become a goalie in professional soccer*, is within his reach. (Appositive)
- Eleanor, *his wife of thirty years*, suddenly decided to open her own business. (Appositive) 
- He is interested in sports, *especially ball games*. (Appositive)
- **He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.**  **2 modifications** (They designed an algorithm, based on MDP, having prohibitive time complexity.)(We introduce the edge probability, denoted by $p$, describing the uncertainty of the status of an edge.) **please familiar with the mean that Past Participle 作后置定语**

Please pay attention to the sentences marked "2 modifications", which can offer methods to construct sentence when a objective with multiple modifications. 


### A almost perfect (at least very usable ) paradigm for describing algorithm complexity:
The implementation of C2P algorithm has been given
in previous part, and in the following we prove the results by
analyzing operations in Algorithm 2 line by line.
Line 1 makes the initialization and the corresponding complexity
is Θ(1). **Operations in line 2 to line 10** include two
“for” loops, where the **outer** one traverses all the neighbors
of node v, denoted by wi, with loop times dv and the **inner**
one traverses part of neighbors of relay node wi. Note that
the inner loop does not need to search all the neighbors of
node wi since that some of them do not own cross-layer two-hop
paths to node v. Then, note that **the operation within two loops** is an assignment **with complexity Θ(1)** and thus we
have that the implementation complexity **is upper bounded by**.
Line 11 selects recommendation items based
on nodes’ weights with complexity Θ(1). Combing the above
three parts together, we complete the proof.
